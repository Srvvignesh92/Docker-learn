# Docker Hub Login Setup Guide

## Prerequisites
- Docker installed and running
- Docker Hub account (create one at https://hub.docker.com/ if you don't have one)
- Docker Hub username and password (or access token)

---

## Step 1: Login to Docker Hub from Terminal
```bash
docker login
```

**Output:**
```
Login with your Docker credentials

Username: your-dockerhub-username
Password: 
WARNING! Your password will be stored unencrypted in /home/user/.docker/config.json
Configure a credential helper to remove this warning. See
https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/login/#credentials-store

Login Succeeded
```

**Purpose:** Authenticates your local Docker client with Docker Hub

---

## Step 2: Verify Login (Optional)
```bash
cat ~/.docker/config.json
```

**Purpose:** Displays the stored credentials (base64 encoded)

---

## Step 3: Use Access Token for Enhanced Security (Recommended)
Instead of using your Docker Hub password, create and use a Personal Access Token:

### A. Create a Personal Access Token on Docker Hub
1. Go to https://hub.docker.com/settings/security
2. Click "New Access Token"
3. Enter a token name (e.g., "Docker-CLI")
4. Select appropriate permissions (Read & Write recommended)
5. Click "Generate"
6. Copy the token and save it securely

### B. Login Using the Access Token
```bash
docker login -u your-dockerhub-username
```

When prompted for password, paste your access token instead of your password.

---

## Step 4: Push an Image to Docker Hub

### A. Build a Docker Image (if you don't have one)
```bash
docker build -t my-app:latest .
```

**Purpose:** Builds a Docker image from a Dockerfile in the current directory

### B. Tag the Image with Your Docker Hub Username
```bash
docker tag my-app:latest your-dockerhub-username/my-app:latest
```

**Purpose:** Tags the local image with your Docker Hub repository format

**Format:** `<docker-hub-username>/<repository-name>:<tag>`

### C. Push the Image to Docker Hub
```bash
docker push your-dockerhub-username/my-app:latest
```

**Example:**
```bash
docker push john-doe/my-app:latest
```

**Purpose:** Uploads the image to your Docker Hub repository

---

## Step 5: Pull an Image from Docker Hub

### A. Pull a Public Image (No Login Required)
```bash
docker pull ubuntu:latest
```

### B. Pull Your Private Image (Login Required)
```bash
docker pull your-dockerhub-username/my-app:latest
```

**Example:**
```bash
docker pull john-doe/my-app:latest
```

**Purpose:** Downloads the image from Docker Hub to your local system

### C. Run the Pulled Image
```bash
docker run -d --name my-container your-dockerhub-username/my-app:latest
```

---

## Step 6: Logout from Docker Hub (if needed)
```bash
docker logout
```

**Purpose:** Removes authentication credentials from your local system

---

## Useful Commands Reference

```bash
# View all local images
docker images

# View all running containers
docker ps

# View all containers (including stopped)
docker ps -a

# Remove an image
docker rmi image-id

# Check login status
docker info | grep Username

# List images in your Docker Hub repository
docker search your-dockerhub-username

# View push/pull history
docker history your-dockerhub-username/my-app:latest
```

---

## Common Workflows

### Complete Push Workflow
```bash
# Build the image
docker build -t my-app:1.0 .

# Tag it with your Docker Hub username
docker tag my-app:1.0 your-dockerhub-username/my-app:1.0

# Login to Docker Hub
docker login

# Push the image
docker push your-dockerhub-username/my-app:1.0
```

### Complete Pull and Run Workflow
```bash
# Pull the image
docker pull your-dockerhub-username/my-app:1.0

# Run the container
docker run -d --name my-app-container your-dockerhub-username/my-app:1.0

# Verify it's running
docker ps
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### 1. "Error response from daemon: unauthorized"
- **Solution:** You haven't logged in or credentials are incorrect
- **Fix:** Run `docker login` again and verify your credentials/token

### 2. "docker: command not found"
- **Solution:** Docker is not installed or not in PATH
- **Fix:** Install Docker or check your Docker installation

### 3. "denied: requested access to the resource is denied"
- **Solution:** Trying to push to a repository you don't have access to
- **Fix:** Ensure the tag matches your username: `your-username/repo-name`

### 4. "Pull access denied"
- **Solution:** Trying to pull a private image without login
- **Fix:** Run `docker login` with the correct credentials

### 5. "Credential stored with wrong username"
- **Solution:** Credentials were stored for a different account
- **Fix:** Run `docker logout` and `docker login` again

## Security Best Practices

✓ Use Personal Access Tokens instead of passwords
✓ Never commit `~/.docker/config.json` to version control
✓ Use credential helpers to encrypt stored credentials:
  ```bash
  # macOS
  brew install docker-credential-osxkeychain
  
  # Linux
  sudo apt-get install docker.io pass
  ```

✓ Regularly rotate access tokens
✓ Limit token permissions to only what's needed
✓ Keep tokens in secure password managers
